# Unit 5 - Financial Planning

## Description

The finances for a typical family are evaluated for potential future growth.

## Portfolio Description

The portfolio consists of a collection of stocks (SPY) and bonds (AGG) with a 60/40 split, along with a selection of cryptocurrencies (BTC and ETH). The total initial portfolio asset values are listed below:

| Asset | Quantity | Value      |
| ----- | -------- | ---------- |
| SPY   | 50       | $16,333.50 |
| AGG   | 200      | $23,546.00 |
| BTC   | 1.2      | $15,916.18 |
| ETH   | 5.3      | $2,072.30  |

Total portfolio values are shown below:

| Portfolio          | Value      |
| ------------------ | --------   |
| Stocks             | $39,879.5  |
| Crypto             | $17,988.48 |
| Combined Portfolio | $57,867.98 |

## Savings & Emergency Fund Considerations

The family's monthly income of $12,000 sets the target emergency fund at $36,000. Since the portfolio value exceeds this quantity, the family is considered safely within the necessary emergency fund requirement.

## Earnings Projects

The family portfolio future returns are simulated using a Monte Carlo simulator. Several conditions are tested. Based on these results, statistically-driven predictions are made on the expected minimum and maximum returns.
